MetaMaster
==========

Small C# utility for displaying contents of MetaStock data index files (MASTER, EMASTER, XMASTER) and exporting stock codes. 

**How it works and what it does** *(I think)*

* Navigate to a directory containing stock market data in MetaStock format.
* Select an index file.
* Click one of the enabled buttons to bring up a dialog that displays the contents of the index file.
* To export all the stock symbols that index file references to a text file, right click the data table and select "Export".
